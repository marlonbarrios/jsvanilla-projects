## PaintR

Experimented with the power of the HTML Canvas element and #vanillajs (jscolor.js) or create a paint tool app: PaintR. The user can select and change the background color, the thickness of the brush, the paint color, erase, reset the canvas, save in local storage and export the 'master pieces' as jpegs to the local computer. Have Fun!

## Theme Animations

I felt like a choreographer creating animation for this  website template. It was nice and elegant already (Creative Tim template), but now the user's gaze is driven by the choreography of the elements.

## Classic Pong

Homage to the classic PONG game with the HTML canvas and #vanillajs to animate the ball and the players. You play against the computer moving the cursor and the bottom paddle; it keeps the score and the winner score is 7; repeat. Have fun!
